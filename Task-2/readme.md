Iris Flower Classification
This project classifies iris flowers into their respective species (setosa, versicolor, virginica) using the famous Iris dataset.

-Steps:
Loaded and explored the Iris dataset to understand its structure.
Preprocessed the data by splitting it into training and testing sets.
Built a Decision Tree Classifier for species classification.
Visualized the decision tree and evaluated its performance.

-Files:
Iris_Classification.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing the complete code.
data/: Folder containing the Iris dataset.

-Results:
The model achieved an accuracy of X% on the test dataset, effectively classifying the species.

-How to Run:
Open the Iris_Classification.ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code.
Ensure the Iris dataset is in the data/ folder.
Execute all cells to reproduce the classification results.

-Requirements:
Python 3.x
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Scikit-learn
