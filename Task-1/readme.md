This project predicts the survival chances of Titanic passengers based on their demographic and ticket-related data.

## Steps:
1. Preprocessed the Titanic dataset to handle missing values and encode categorical data.
2. Built a logistic regression model to predict survival chances.
3. Visualized the results to evaluate the model's accuracy.

## Files:
- **Titanic_Analysis.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook containing the code.
- **data/**: Folder containing the Titanic dataset.

## Results:
The model achieved an accuracy of **X%** on the test dataset.
