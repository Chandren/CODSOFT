##Credit Card Fraud Detection
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent transactions using a highly imbalanced credit card dataset.

##Steps:
Loaded and explored the credit card dataset for class imbalance and feature distribution.
Preprocessed the data by scaling features and handling the imbalance using SMOTE.
Built a Random Forest Classifier for fraud detection.
Evaluated the model's performance using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score.

##Files:
CreditCard_FraudDetection.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing the code.
data/: Folder containing the credit card fraud dataset.

##Results:
The model achieved an F1-score of X%, effectively identifying fraudulent transactions while minimizing false positives.

##How to Run:
Open the CreditCard_FraudDetection.ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code.
Ensure the credit card dataset is present in the data/ folder.
Run all cells to reproduce the results.

##Requirements:
Python 3.x
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Scikit-learn
Imbalanced-learn (for SMOTE)
